# P&ID Knowledge Graph Assistant

An intelligent system that converts Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;IDs) into Knowledge Graphs and provides a natural language interface for querying technical information. The system uses LangChain for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), integrating LLM models with vector databases and knowledge graphs.

## Key Features
- Natural language query processing
- P&ID to Knowledge Graph conversion
- Integration with LLM models (Gemini-2/DeepSeek)
- Vector database integration (ChromaDB)
- Knowledge Graph storage (Neo4j)
- Gradio-based user interface
